Here is a list of open source software that are useful in a professional context.

## VSCodium

Microsoft's Visual Studio Code is a powerful text editor / light IDE with a very modern design, and a rich plugin ecosystem. While it is already open-source, it contains binaries and telemetry that is proprietary. VSCodium is a version of the project without any of the analytics and closed-source code.
